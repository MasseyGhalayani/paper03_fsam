# Friendly Sharpness-Aware Minimization

The code is the official implementation of our CVPR 2024 paper 
[Friendly Sharpness-Aware Minimization](https://arxiv.org/html/2403.12350v1).

In this work, we reveal that the full gradient component in SAMâ€™s adversarial perturbation does not contribute to generalization and, in fact, has undesirable effects. We then propose an efficient variant to mitigate these effects and further enhance the generalization performance of SAM.
